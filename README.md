# Portfolio of practical work of the Introduction of Software testing - University of Minnesota.
This course was good in the structure of the introduction to test automation, an important aspect of improving my skills during the development course was the presence of practical tasks, that required basic knowledge of Java programming and it was a very good boost for me because practical tasks were mandatory.

I performed the following tasks:
1) writing unit tests for the main functionality of the coffee maker;
2) writing unit tests for the coffee machine with verification of the coverage of the main functions (it was necessary to achieve coverage of 80% of the main functionality)
3) writing a test plan and test cases according to the provided requirements for the project.

I gained good knowledge and practical skills of:
- Automation: Writing JUnit tests
- Understanding of Test-Driven Development
- The "V Model" of Software Development
- Mutation Testing
- Assessing Adequacy and Code Coverage Analysis with JaCoCo
- Flakey Tests and How to Avoid Them
- Understanding of OOP
- Practice in writing unit tests
- Basics of Java, Gradlew, and JUnit

Thank you, Kevin Wendt and Sanjai Rayadurgam.
